#Fantastic vim
As you can guess by the title of this site, i'am a vim user. Here i collect
all the vim addon i use, maybe someone find it useful. Most of the addons
concerning programming, especially C++. You can find my vimrc on
[github]("https://github.com/Blonck/dotfiles"). I try to keep this list up to
date.

###Vundle
The most important addon is [vundle]("https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim").
It is just wonderful and makes it easy to manage all other addons. Installing,
updating and removing, everything is handled with simple commands. If you want
to use any vim addon, use this one first.

After installing Vundle one can install any addon located on github (or any
other git repository) by adding:  

`Plugin SomeRepository`  

to your vimrc and executing  

`:BundleInstall`  

inside vim. To update all installed addons is even easier. Just execute

`:BundleUpdate`

inside vim and it Vundle will pull all the updates from the corresponding git
repositories.

###UltiSnips
The second most important addon for me is the snippet engine
[UltiSnips]("https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips"), it speeds up writing code
or any kind of structured text. Although i use approximately only 5% of its
capabilities is helps me a lot.

###vim-fugitive
[Vim-Fuigitive]("https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive") is a mighty git
wrapper inside vim. With it one can handle all the daily workflow things
around git in vim. The simplest example is to add a file to the staging area
and commit it.  You just have to execute

`:GWrite`

, which will add the current buffer to the staging area and then

`:Gcommit`

will open a new buffer where you can edit the commit message. Just save and
close this buffer and your commit is ready.

###YouCompleteMe
This addon does what it says, at least for me. I tries to complete words
as-you-type, which is especially useful when writing code. Additionally it can
use libclang to do a semantic code completion for C/C++ which is the reason I
use it.  For the libclang part the installation is a little bit complicated,
but it is worth it. Just have a look
[here]("https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe"). If you use it together
with UltiSnips these 3 lines inside your vimrc are useful.

```let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger='<C-l>'```  
```let g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger='<C-j>'```  
```let g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger='<C-k>'```

### writegood.vim
[writegood.vim]("https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/writegood.vim") helps if
it comes to writing English text. It detects duplicated words, highlight use
of passive and common "weasel words". Just enable it via:

`:WritegoodEnable`

### nerdtree and vim-nerdtree-tabs
With [nerdtree]("https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree") one can navigate
through the filesystem inside vim and
[vim-nerdtree-tabs]("https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs") integrate it
well when working with tabs. I use the following mapping to toggle the
nerdtree window:

`nnoremap <F4> :NERDTreeTabsToggle<CR>`

### vim-startify
On startup [vim-startify]("https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify") shows you
your last used files, which helps me a lot. But thats not all, it makes it
easy to store and load sessions. Sessions are a set of open buffers or tabs.
To save the current session just execute:

`:SSave NameOfTheSession`

and if you want to load it:

`:SLoad NameOfTheSession`

### vim-colors-solarized
[Solarizd]("https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized") just a nice color scheme i use not
only for vim, it is also nice for any kind of terminals.
To toggle the background color a use the following keybinding:

```call togglebg#map("<F6>")```

### gundo
With [gundo]("https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim") visualize the vim undo tree.
The last changes are displayed in a tree and one can undo not only the last one.
To display gundo i use the keybinding:

```nnoremap <F5> :GundoToggle<CR>```

### VimOrganizer
[VimOrganizer]("https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer") is a clone of the Org-mode of emacs.
Although it doesn't implement all of the features of emacs, it is enough to handle existing org files properly.
This is enough for me.

### python-mode
[Python-Mode]("https://github.com/klen/python-mode") is the batteries included python addon for vim.
It handles static code analysis, refactoring, code completion and on the fly linting of you python code.
